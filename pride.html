<p align="center">Pride and Prejudice is one of the earliest and most influential examples of a novel of manners. By the 1700s, social classes and hierarchies had started to change in England. Due to the rise of industry and capitalism, it was now becoming possible for some people to earn significant amounts of money during their lifetime even if they had not been born into wealthy families. This shift meant that social identity became more complicated. A new emphasis was placed on subtle behaviors that signaled someone’s class background. Examples might include how one dressed, the vocabulary one used, one’s table manners, and what sort of topics one understood to be appropriate for discussion. All these subtle visual or behavioral cues indicated whether a person had been born into their money and were therefore truly upper class, or whether they had acquired their money in their lifetime and were therefore not truly members of the upper classes.</p>
