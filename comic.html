<p align="center">Anime (Japanese: アニメ, [aɲime] (About this soundlisten); plural: anime), sometimes called Japanimation, is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. The term is derived from the English word animation, and is used in Japan as a blanket term for all animated media. Outside of Japan, anime is used either to refer to animation made in Japan, or to a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters, and fantastical themes.

The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread in the second half of the 20th century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime can be distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games.

The anime industry in Japan consists of over 430 production studios, with major firms including Studio Ghibli, Gainax, and Toei Animation. Despite comprising only a fraction of the country's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese DVD and Blu-ray sales. Since the 1980s, anime has also seen increasing international success with the rise of foreign-dubbed and subbed programming. As of 2016, anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.
